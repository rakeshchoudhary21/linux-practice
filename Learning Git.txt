# Learning Git
1- To create an empty git repo
    git init
2- to stage files for git to track
    git add -A # for all files, or git add *.txt # for adding only text files
3- to commit stuff
    git commit -m 'message for commit'
4- to add remote repository
    git remote add origin https://github.com/rakeshchoudhary21/linux-practice.git
5- to push your changes
    git push origin <branch name>
6- to create a new branch
    git checkout -b my_new_branch
7- to see man page of git.
    git help <name of git command>
8- to see log of git activity
    git log
9- to see diff of a file from last commit(shows only for tracked files)
    git diff file_name
10- Say you make change to a file that is already committed. Now you have 2 options, commit the update or discard,
    to discard the change use checkout
    git checkout name_of_updated_file
11- Adding user name and commit email
    git config --global user.name 'my name'
    git config --global user.email 'my email address'
12- you can call merge to merge a branch into another branch
    call merge from branch to which you want to merge, then add name of branch from which you want to merge
    git checkout master
    git merge some_branch_into_master
13- In case of conflict during git merge, the branch goes into a limbo, now you have two options, either abort the merge or resolve
    the conflict and then do git commit

14- git remote shows ur current remote. We will generally add more remotes, since we generally fork from actual branches and then
    go for the git merge. So we will need 2 remotes, one that points to our own git fork, and other that points to org remote.
15- git push (without any args here will push local changes to current remote and current git branch)
    git push my-remote my-branch

16- Md files-- MarkDown is a markup language just like HTML. They decorate(mark) written text.
    Mark down tricks::
    # Single hash is large heading
    ## smaller heading.
    **my_text** two stars around text make it BOLD
    *italics* single star makes it italics
    - single dash is for making dot based bullet points
    `some code` makes things appear like a code...
    use triple quote for making code blocks
    ```
    psvm(String[] args){
        sout("its here for some reason");
    }
    ```

    Adding links::
    [My link to something](https://google.com)
    ![Linke to some image](Image file link)


17- Upstream:: This is unsually where a given branch is forked from.
